# Fine-Tuning Stable Diffusion on Gaming Assets

<br>

## Introduction

Welcome to our repository dedicated to fine-tuning Stable Diffusion, an open-source neural network for generating high-quality images. This project aims to enhance the capabilities of Stable Diffusion by fine-tuning it with gaming asset datasets.

Stable Diffusion is a deep learning, text-to-image model released in 2022 based on diffusion techniques. It is primarily used to generate detailed images conditioned on text descriptions, though it can also be applied to other tasks such as inpainting, outpainting, and generating image-to-image translations guided by a text prompt (Wikipedia contributors, 2024).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Installing the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Preparation

To prepare your data for fine-tuning the Stable Diffusion model, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Organize Your Dataset

Place the dataset you wish to use for fine-tuning inside the `./data/images/` folder. Ensure that your dataset consists of high-quality images relevant to the gaming domain or any other style you're targeting.

### Step 2: Automatic Captioning
The dataset for fine-tuning requires not just images, but also corresponding captions. To generate captions, use the script provided in `./auto_captioning/auto_captioning.ipynb`. Follow the instructions in the notebook to automatically create captions for each image in the data folder. Ensure that the captions generated are accurate and descriptive of the content in the images. If necessary, manually review and adjust the captions for accuracy and relevance.
